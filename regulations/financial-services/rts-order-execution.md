# RTS Order Execution Policies (2025)

## Overview

**ESMA Final Report April 2025** introduces new **Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS)** for order execution policies under MiFID II Article 27. These standards will standardize execution policy content, review frequency, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across the EU.

## Key Developments

### ESMA Final Report (April 2025)
