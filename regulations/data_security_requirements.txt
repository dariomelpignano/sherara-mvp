Information Security Management System (ISMS)
Organizations must establish and maintain a comprehensive ISMS aligned with recognized standards such as ISO 27001. The ISMS must include documented policies and procedures, defined roles and responsibilities, regular risk assessments, and continuous improvement processes. Management commitment and adequate resource allocation are essential for effective implementation.

Data Classification and Handling
All data must be classified according to sensitivity levels: public, internal, confidential, and highly confidential. Each classification level requires specific handling procedures including access controls, encryption requirements, retention periods, and disposal methods. Classification must be reviewed regularly and updated when data sensitivity changes.

Access Control Management
Implement principle of least privilege for all system access. User access rights must be formally requested, approved, and regularly reviewed. Multi-factor authentication required for privileged accounts and remote access. Access logs must be maintained and monitored for unauthorized attempts. Segregation of duties must be enforced for critical functions.

Encryption Requirements
Data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit using industry-standard algorithms. Minimum encryption standards: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit. Encryption keys must be properly managed including secure generation, storage, rotation, and destruction. Key management procedures must be documented and audited.

Network Security Controls
Network segmentation must isolate critical systems and sensitive data. Firewalls must be configured with deny-all default rules. Intrusion detection and prevention systems required for critical networks. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing must be conducted. Network access control (NAC) should be implemented for device authentication.

Endpoint Protection
All endpoints must have updated antivirus/anti-malware protection. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions recommended for advanced threat detection. Operating systems and applications must be regularly patched. Mobile device management (MDM) required for corporate mobile devices. USB and removable media controls must be implemented.

Security Monitoring and Logging
Centralized logging of security events from all critical systems required. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system should correlate and analyze logs. Real-time alerting for security incidents must be configured. Log retention must meet regulatory requirements (minimum 12 months). Regular review of security alerts and anomalies is mandatory.

Incident Response Planning
Documented incident response plan must include: incident classification and escalation procedures, roles and responsibilities of response team, communication protocols for stakeholders and authorities, evidence preservation and forensic procedures, and recovery and lessons learned processes. Plan must be tested regularly through simulations.

Vulnerability Management
Regular vulnerability assessments of all systems and applications required. Critical vulnerabilities must be patched within defined timeframes: critical within 24-48 hours, high within 7 days, medium within 30 days. Vulnerability management process must include discovery, prioritization, remediation, and verification phases.

Third-Party Security Management
Security requirements must be included in all vendor contracts. Due diligence assessments required before engaging third parties. Ongoing monitoring of third-party security posture necessary. Right to audit clauses should be included in contracts. Critical vendors must provide security certifications and attestations.

Physical Security Controls
Data centers and server rooms must have appropriate physical controls including: access control systems with authentication, CCTV monitoring and recording, environmental controls for temperature and humidity, fire suppression systems, and backup power supplies. Visitor access must be logged and escorted.

Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) must identify critical systems and data. Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) must be defined. Backup procedures must ensure data can be recovered within defined objectives. DR plans must be tested at least annually. Off-site backup storage required for critical data.

Security Awareness Training
All employees must receive security awareness training upon joining and annually thereafter. Training topics must include: phishing and social engineering recognition, password security and management, data handling procedures, incident reporting requirements, and physical security awareness. Training effectiveness should be measured through testing.

Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Centralized IAM system should manage user lifecycle from provisioning to de-provisioning. Strong password policies must be enforced including complexity, length, and rotation requirements. Privileged access management (PAM) solution required for administrative accounts. Regular access reviews and certification campaigns must be conducted.

Cloud Security Requirements
Cloud services must undergo security assessment before adoption. Data residency and sovereignty requirements must be verified. Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) recommended for visibility and control. Shared responsibility model must be understood and documented. Cloud-specific security controls must be implemented and monitored.

Mobile Security
Mobile device policy must address both corporate and BYOD devices. Mobile devices must be encrypted and password protected. Remote wipe capability required for lost or stolen devices. Application whitelisting or containerization should be implemented. Regular security updates must be enforced through MDM.

Application Security
Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) must be implemented. Security testing including SAST, DAST, and penetration testing required. OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities must be addressed. Security code reviews mandatory for critical applications. Third-party components must be inventoried and monitored for vulnerabilities.

Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
DLP solutions should monitor and prevent unauthorized data exfiltration. Policies must cover email, web traffic, and endpoint activities. Sensitive data patterns must be defined and regularly updated. Incident workflows for DLP alerts must be established. User education on DLP policies is essential.

Cryptographic Controls
Approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols must be defined. Certificate management procedures required for PKI implementation. Quantum-safe cryptography roadmap should be developed. Cryptographic controls must be regularly reviewed and updated. Hardware security modules (HSM) recommended for key storage.

Compliance and Audit
Regular internal security audits must be conducted. External audits required for regulatory compliance. Audit findings must be tracked to remediation. Continuous compliance monitoring should be implemented. Security metrics and KPIs must be reported to management.

Zero Trust Architecture
Organizations should move towards Zero Trust principles including: verify explicitly for every access request, apply least privilege access principles, assume breach and minimize blast radius, continuous verification of security posture, and micro-segmentation of networks and applications.

Supply Chain Security
Software supply chain must be secured including: vendor security assessments, software composition analysis, integrity verification of software components, monitoring for supply chain vulnerabilities, and incident response procedures for supply chain attacks.

Emerging Technology Risks
Security controls must adapt to emerging technologies including: artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, quantum computing implications, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, and 5G network implementations. Risk assessments must consider these technologies.
