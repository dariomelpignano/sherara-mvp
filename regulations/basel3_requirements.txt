PART A - MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

1. DEFINITION OF CAPITAL

1.1 Components of Capital
Capital consists of the sum of Tier 1 Capital (going-concern capital) and Tier 2 Capital (gone-concern capital).

Tier 1 Capital = Common Equity Tier 1 + Additional Tier 1

1.2 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
- Common shares issued by the bank
- Stock surplus (share premium)
- Retained earnings
- Accumulated other comprehensive income
- Common shares issued by consolidated subsidiaries
- Regulatory adjustments and deductions

1.3 Additional Tier 1 (AT1)
- Instruments issued by the bank that meet criteria
- Stock surplus from AT1 instruments
- Instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries
- Regulatory adjustments

1.4 Tier 2 Capital
- Instruments that meet criteria
- Stock surplus from Tier 2 instruments
- Instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries
- Certain loan loss provisions
- Regulatory adjustments

2. RISK COVERAGE

2.1 Credit Risk
Standardised Approach:
- Risk weights based on external ratings
- Due diligence requirements
- Exposures to sovereigns, banks, corporates
- Retail exposures
- Real estate exposures
- Off-balance sheet items

Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach:
- Foundation IRB (F-IRB)
- Advanced IRB (A-IRB)
- Probability of Default (PD)
- Loss Given Default (LGD)
- Exposure at Default (EAD)
- Effective Maturity (M)

2.2 Market Risk
- Standardised approach
- Internal models approach
- Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB)
- Value-at-Risk (VaR)
- Stressed VaR
- Incremental Risk Charge (IRC)
- Comprehensive Risk Measure (CRM)

2.3 Operational Risk
- Basic Indicator Approach (BIA)
- Standardised Approach (TSA)
- Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA)
- New Standardised Approach (2023)

3. MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS

3.1 Minimum Requirements
- Common Equity Tier 1: 4.5% of RWA
- Tier 1 Capital: 6.0% of RWA
- Total Capital: 8.0% of RWA

3.2 Capital Conservation Buffer
- Additional CET1 of 2.5% of RWA
- Restrictions on distributions when buffer breached

3.3 Countercyclical Capital Buffer
- Range of 0-2.5% of RWA
- Set by national authorities
- CET1 capital requirement

3.4 Capital Buffers for Systemically Important Banks
- Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs): 1.0-3.5%
- Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs): determined nationally

4. LEVERAGE RATIO

4.1 Definition
Leverage Ratio = Tier 1 Capital / Exposure Measure

4.2 Minimum Requirement
- 3% minimum leverage ratio

4.3 Exposure Measure
- On-balance sheet exposures
- Derivative exposures
- Securities financing transaction exposures
- Off-balance sheet items

4.4 G-SIB Leverage Ratio Buffer
- Additional leverage ratio buffer for G-SIBs
- Set at 50% of risk-weighted G-SIB buffer

5. LIQUIDITY STANDARDS

5.1 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
LCR = High-Quality Liquid Assets / Total Net Cash Outflows over 30 days ≥ 100%

HQLA Categories:
- Level 1: Cash, central bank reserves, sovereign debt
- Level 2A: Certain sovereign, corporate and covered bonds
- Level 2B: Lower rated corporate bonds, RMBS, equities

5.2 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
NSFR = Available Stable Funding / Required Stable Funding ≥ 100%

ASF factors based on:
- Capital items
- Retail and SME deposits
- Wholesale funding
- Other liabilities

RSF factors based on:
- Cash and central bank reserves
- Securities
- Loans
- Other assets

6. PILLAR 2 - SUPERVISORY REVIEW PROCESS

6.1 Four Key Principles
1. Banks should have process for assessing capital adequacy
2. Supervisors should review banks' assessments

4. Supervisors should intervene to prevent capital falling below minimum

6.2 Main Features
- Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)
- Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)
- Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB)
- Credit concentration risk
- Operational risk
