# Industry-Specific Regulations Display Fix

## Problem
When starting each industry-specific version, the regulations section at `http://localhost:3000/#regulations` was not showing only the regulations appropriate for that specific sector. Instead, it might show generic regulations or not load them properly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Regulation Loading Flow**
- **Added automatic regulation loading** when the regulations section is accessed via `loadSectionData()`
- **Made regulations load on app startup** for immediate availability
- **Updated tab switching** to load regulations before rendering them

### 2. **Default Tab Changed**
- **Changed default active tab** from "Data Sources" to "Regulation Library"
- **Users now see regulations immediately** instead of seeing data source management first
- **Library tab shows industry-specific regulations** relevant to their sector

### 3. **Enhanced Loading Logic**
```javascript
// Before: renderRegulations() called without loading
case 'regulations':
    renderRegulations();
    break;

// After: Load regulations first, then render
case 'regulations':
    await loadRegulations();
    renderRegulations();
    break;
```

### 4. **Tab Management Fix**
```javascript
// Before: Only rendered regulations
if (tabName === 'library') {
    renderRegulations();
}

// After: Load first, then render
if (tabName === 'library') {
    loadRegulations().then(() => renderRegulations());
}
```

### 5. **Improved Empty State Handling**
- **Added proper empty state** when no regulations are available
- **Provided refresh button** to retry loading regulations
- **Clear user feedback** about what's happening

### 6. **Debug Information Added**
- **Console logging** to verify industry-specific regulation loading
- **Shows regulation count and names** for verification
- **Helps troubleshoot industry configuration issues**

## How It Works Now

### For Medicinal Gases Industry:
```bash
npm run start:medical
# or
node server.js --industry=medicinal-gases
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/#regulations` and you'll see **only**:
1. **EU GMP** - Enhanced medicinal gas manufacturing requirements
2. **ISO 7396** - Medical gas pipeline systems standards  
3. **Medicinal Gas Manufacturing** - Comprehensive manufacturing framework
4. **Gruppo Sol Regulatory Framework** - Real industry requirements from 32-country operations
5. **GDPR** - Data protection (applies to all industries)

### For Financial Services Industry:
```bash
npm run start:financial
# or
node server.js --industry=financial-services
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/#regulations` and you'll see **only**:
1. **MiFID II** - Investment services regulation
2. **Basel III** - Banking capital requirements
3. **DORA** - Digital operational resilience
4. **GDPR** - Data protection (applies to all industries)

### For Food & Beverages Industry:
```bash
npm run start:food
# or  
node server.js --industry=food-beverages
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/#regulations` and you'll see **only**:
1. **HACCP** - Hazard analysis and critical control points
2. **EU Food Law** - European food safety regulations
3. **GDPR** - Data protection (applies to all industries)

## Verification Steps

### 1. **Check Industry Configuration**
Open browser console and look for:
```
Loading industry-specific regulations...
Loaded regulations for current industry: [array of regulations]
Found X regulations: RegulationName1, RegulationName2, ...
```

### 2. **Verify API Response**
Check that `/analyze/regulations` returns industry-specific regulations:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/analyze/regulations
```

### 3. **Test Tab Functionality**
- Regulations section loads with "Regulation Library" tab active
- Only industry-appropriate regulations are displayed
- No generic fallback regulations mixed in

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration
- Uses existing `industryConfig.js` service
- Calls `/analyze/regulations` endpoint
- Returns industry-specific regulation list

### Frontend Updates
- Modified `loadSectionData()` function
- Updated `switchRegulationTab()` logic
- Enhanced `renderRegulations()` with empty states
- Added regulation loading to app initialization

### Configuration
- Industry set via command line parameter: `--industry=medicinal-gases`
- Or via npm scripts: `npm run start:medical`
- Or via interactive selection: `npm run start:interactive`
