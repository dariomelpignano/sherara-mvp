# AI System Development Policy

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes guidelines for the development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems within our organization. It ensures compliance with ethical principles and regulatory requirements.

## 2. Risk Assessment Framework

### 2.1 Risk Categorization
All AI systems must be assessed and categorized according to risk levels:
- Minimal risk
- Limited risk
- High risk
- Unacceptable risk

### 2.2 High-Risk AI Systems
High-risk AI systems require:
- Conformity assessment before deployment
- Continuous monitoring during operation
- Regular audits and reviews

## 3. Development Requirements

### 3.1 Data Governance
- Training data must be relevant and representative
- Data quality must be ensured throughout the lifecycle
- Bias mitigation strategies must be implemented

### 3.2 Technical Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is required including:
- System architecture and design
- Algorithm descriptions
- Training methodology
- Performance metrics

### 3.3 Testing and Validation
- Systematic testing procedures must be followed
- Performance benchmarks must be established
- Edge cases must be identified and tested

## 4. Transparency and Explainability

### 4.1 User Information
Users must be informed when interacting with an AI system. Clear information about system capabilities and limitations must be provided.

### 4.2 Explainable AI
Where feasible, AI systems should provide explanations for their outputs. Decision-making processes should be interpretable.

## 5. Human Oversight

### 5.1 Human-in-the-Loop
Critical decisions must maintain human oversight. Operators must be able to intervene or override AI decisions.

### 5.2 Training Requirements
Personnel operating AI systems must receive appropriate training on:
- System capabilities and limitations
- Intervention procedures
- Risk identification

## 6. Accuracy and Robustness

### 6.1 Performance Standards
AI systems must meet defined accuracy thresholds. Regular performance monitoring is required.

### 6.2 Cybersecurity
Appropriate cybersecurity measures must be implemented:
- Protection against adversarial attacks
- Secure development practices
- Regular security assessments

## 7. Ethical Considerations

### 7.1 Fairness and Non-Discrimination
AI systems must not create or perpetuate unfair bias. Regular bias audits must be conducted.

### 7.2 Privacy Protection
AI development must respect privacy rights. Privacy impact assessments are required for systems processing personal data.

## 8. Compliance and Monitoring

### 8.1 Regulatory Compliance
All AI systems must comply with applicable regulations including the EU AI Act.

### 8.2 Incident Reporting
Serious incidents or malfunctions must be reported to relevant authorities within required timeframes.

## 9. Quality Management

A quality management system must be established covering:
- Design and development procedures
- Testing and validation processes
- Post-deployment monitoring
- Continuous improvement

## 10. Record Keeping

Comprehensive records must be maintained including:
- Technical documentation
- Test results
- Incident reports
- Audit findings

Records must be retained for the required period and made available to authorities upon request.
