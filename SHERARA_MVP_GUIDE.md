## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. Configure OpenAI API (Optional)
To enable AI features, add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 2. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Test with Sample Documents
Use the provided sample documents in the `sample-docs/` directory:
- `sample-privacy-policy.txt` - Test GDPR compliance
- `sample-security-policy.txt` - Test security requirements
- `sample-ai-policy.txt` - Test AI Act compliance

## 📱 Using the Application

### Step 1: Upload Documents
1. Click on "Documents" in the navigation
2. Click "Choose file" or drag and drop
3. Select document type (Policy, Procedure, etc.)
4. Click "Upload"

### Step 2: Analyze Compliance
1. Navigate to "Analysis"
2. Select a document from the dropdown
3. Choose regulations to check against
4. Click "Analyze Compliance"

### Step 3: Review Results
- View identified compliance gaps
- Check risk scores (High/Medium/Low)
- Read specific recommendations
- Generate remediation plans

### Step 4: Use AI Assistant
1. Click on "AI Assistant"
2. Ask questions about:
   - Specific regulations
   - Your compliance gaps
   - Best practices
   - Remediation strategies

## 🔍 Key Features Demonstration

### Compliance Gap Detection
The system automatically identifies:
- Missing required elements
- Partial compliance areas
- Policy weaknesses
- Documentation gaps

### Risk Scoring
Each gap is scored 1-10 based on:
- Regulatory importance
- Potential penalties
- Implementation difficulty
- Business impact

### AI-Powered Insights
- Contextual explanations
- Tailored recommendations
- Best practice suggestions
- Implementation guidance

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Session-Based Storage**: All data is cleared after 30 minutes of inactivity
2. **No Persistence**: Documents and analysis results are not saved between sessions
3. **AI Features**: Require valid OpenAI API key in `.env` file
4. **File Limits**: Maximum 10MB per file

## 🧪 Testing the MVP

### Quick Test Flow:
1. Upload `sample-privacy-policy.txt`
2. Analyze against GDPR
3. Review the gaps identified
4. Ask the AI Assistant: "How can I improve my GDPR compliance?"

### Expected Results:
- Multiple compliance gaps identified
- Risk scores assigned
- Specific recommendations provided
- AI provides actionable guidance

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- No data persistence beyond session
- Server-side processing only
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization
- Session timeout after 30 minutes

## 📈 Next Steps

This MVP demonstrates core functionality. For production:
1. Add user authentication
2. Implement persistent database
3. Add PDF report generation
4. Enable real-time regulatory updates
5. Add multi-language support
6. Implement audit trails

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### AI Features Not Working
- Check if OpenAI API key is set in `.env`
- Verify API key has credits
- Check console for error messages

### Upload Failures
- Ensure file is under 10MB
- Check file format (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT)
- Verify session hasn't expired

### Server Issues
- Check if port 3000 is available
- Verify all dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- Check console for error messages
